# trafficbot
A simple Python Traffic Bot

Welcome to the TrafficBot Wiki!

Add up as many URLs as you need for a single loop. Just keep adding the new line :

webbrowser.open_new_tab('http://url/') time.sleep(10)

http://url/ -> Can be replaced with your Link where you want the Traffic to be generated . time.sleep(10) -> Makes sure your browser does'nt Crash . Its a Time delay of 10 seconds between opening of the Tabs 

Make sure you run a Proxy on your browser otherwise maybe the Analystics dont consider clicks in Counts .
